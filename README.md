# MJML WebApp

Simple WebApp wrapper for MJML to be used by non-tech users.

__Why?__

Even though MJML has a node package to render templates, we can't use all of its features in a web environment, since it was made for Node, not browser. Therefore, non-tech users would have to install and learn a lot of things not needed for them to be able to create simple templates.
__So...__ Aiming for a fast solution, I created this simple wrapper that works for most of the MJML default components, including one of the most needed for my case: _mj-include_.
